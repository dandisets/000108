description: This dataset contains images of 1 mm sections of human brain tissue showing
  nuclei, NeuN+ cells and blood vessels. Each tissue section was first SHIELD-processed
  for protein protection and delipidated to clear the tissue. The tissues were stained
  with YOYO1 (nuclei), anti-NeuN antibody (with Rhodamine Red-X secondary antibody)
  and Lectin (blood vessel) for 8 days in total and then optically cleared using ExPROTOS
  (a refractive matching solution). The sample was imaged using light sheet microscopy
  at a resolution of ~2.5 um x 3.6 um x 2.5 um. Each slab was imaged using multiple
  stacks. Offset transforms are included with the dataset to enable reconstruction
  of each slab.
