description: This dataset contains images of 2 mm sections of a human brain, stained
  with NeuN. Each section was delipidated to clear the tissue and stabilized using
  an elastic polyacrylamide gel. The sample was imaged using light sheet microscopy
  at a resolution of ~2.5 um x 3.6 um x 2.5 um. Each slab was imaged using multiple
  stacks. Offset transforms are included with the dataset to enable reconstruction
  of each slab.
